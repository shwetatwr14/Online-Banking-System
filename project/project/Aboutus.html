        <h1>Transfer Policy & Procedure</h1>
        <p style="font-style: inherit;font-size: 20px;padding-left: 10px;text-align: justify;">
    Washington University recognizes that staff motivation, productivity, and retention are dependent upon people working in jobs that are well suited to their interests, and therefore 
    offers and encourages transfer opportunities for current employees. Likewise, supervisors should be supportive of 
    staff members who have the desire to enhance their skills or develop new competencies to pursue different or greater 
    responsibilities internally.
    <br><br>
    In all cases, the employee’s work record, including but not limited to performance, attendance, efforts to develop 
    skills and related behavior will be used as valid criteria for determining suitability for a position.</p>
